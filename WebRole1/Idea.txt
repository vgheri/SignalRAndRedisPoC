We have a page where the user can choose to live-follow an auction. 
If someone places a bid on the article, the user will immediately be notified with a toast message.

Operations:

- Follow auction: for each auction we keep track of the connection IDs of the user following it
- Place bid: when someone places a bid, we inform all follower of the auction (except the bidder) that there is a new bid

Dictionary:
{
    "auctionNr", [list_of_connection_ids]
}
